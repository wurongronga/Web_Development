    <p>

        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl,
        is a type of domesticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">fowl</a>, originally from Southeastern
        Asia.
        Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called a cockerel.
        A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually
        mmature female is called a pullet.

        Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies,
        chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period
        (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[1][2] Humans now keep
        chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
